= Accounting

The OFBiz accounting system is a core application component and has most of the
modern features you would expect in a general purpose double-entry accounting
system. However, OFBiz goes beyond that by integrating the accounting
functionality with other core components including party, product and order
management. This makes the system as a whole robust and integrated to provide
more value than a plain accounting system.
